In the attached qmd document, I assess the controversial topic of when to punt vs when to go for it. At it's core the debate is about weighing the value of field positioning. There are three general conclusions if we ignore field goals: turnover within the first-down line, turnover at a more advantageous spot and a first down. Will the difference in positioning of the turnovers worth risking for a new set of downs?
